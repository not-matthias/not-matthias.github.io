Hey, I'm @not-matthias. I'm interested in:
- Software Engineering (Rust, C++, React, Vue, ...)
- Artifical Intelligence ([GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [DL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), ...)
- Computer Vision
- Reverse Engineering
- Software Security
- Game Modding

I'm currenty studying Computer Science at the [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://jku.at), Austria. In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, and reading. I'm also a big fan of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org). On this blog I write about projects I'm working on as well as general topics I'm interested in.
