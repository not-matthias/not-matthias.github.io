I'm Matthias, a software engineer from Austria 🇦🇹 currently living in the Netherlands 🇳🇱. I'm working at [CodSpeed](https://codspeed.io) building the next generation of performance benchmarking tools.

I enjoy working on [projects](/projects) that challenge me and allow me to learn things, whether it's writing a [kernel driver with Rust](/posts/kernel-driver-with-rust/), reverse engineering and deobfuscating anticheats, or building a flashcard generator with LLMs. I also enjoy sharing that knowledge by [writing blog posts](/posts) and [speaking at meetups and conferences](/talks).

When I'm not coding, I spend my time running, cooking, reading about philosophy, tinkering with my home lab, and studying Chinese (哈哈哈哈没错).
